#### Project: LinkedIn scraping - 27 Feb 2019
> Concept :
Set 1 of Company URLs
Set 2 of Specific Designation
Result : Scraping all the Employees in given companies with that Designation
Environment : Jupyter, VisualStudio Language : Python Libraries : BeautifulSoup, Selenium,
"Execute in proper id for better execution"
Disclaimer :
Linkedin is restricted to provide exact names on random ids.
With API admin rights, very small script can work.
Linkedin profiles can be extracted easily via first name and company in Google search, but due to multiple "Linkedin" string in first name, Script cannot proceed.
Thats why I didn't proceed with parallel google search for faster script execution.
With a valid Fisrtname and Company name : Another script could be attach to fill user profiles in very less execution time.
 
#### Project: LinkedIn-and-Google - 02 Mar 2019
 > Scrip will do :
Login via LinkedIn
Login via Google
Search sections from Excel File
Open Linkedin profiles and adding to another Excel Column
